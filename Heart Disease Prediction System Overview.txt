Heart Disease Prediction System

Overview:

Developed a comprehensive system to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. The project involved critical findings and noteworthy aspects:

Data Exploration and Visualization:

Explored the heart disease dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
Notable Finding: Identified a strong positive correlation between 'thalach' (maximum heart rate achieved) and the likelihood of heart disease.
Visualized key features, correlations, and distribution using various plots and statistical measures.

Model Implementation:

1-Employed Logistic Regression and Random Forest models for heart disease prediction.

2-Utilized feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.

3-Important Finding: Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression, achieving an accuracy of 86%.

4-Compared and evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report metrics.
